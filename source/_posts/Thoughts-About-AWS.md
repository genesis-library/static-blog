I attended the AWS bootcamp provided by Patika in partnership with A101.\
A 7-hour Amazon workshop was held and AWS was explained.\
We used SQS, SNS, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway using Cloud9 console.\


During AWS bootcamp, most of our time was spent editing yml files.\
It has been said that these are best practices, but I'm still wondering if tools like claudiajs, serverless can help or not. Or can they help with every feature of AWS?\

I think the learning steep of AWS is steep but rewarding.


Still, there are some questions to ask:
I couldn't figure out how much I would pay for using SQS, SNS, Lambda, Gateway, DynamoDB while I deploy my project.\
This requires a good analysis.\
Or malicious people can attack endpoints and wake up one morning to find out that I have to pay $1000.\
In order to prevent this, I have no idea whether I need to use the cloudFront service or if it is set automatically.\
I'm gonna stick onto DigitalOcean for a while.
