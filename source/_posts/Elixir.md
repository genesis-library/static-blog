Since I want to write the information to be written here as accurately as possible, I have not complete my article about elixir yet.


But I can say that we should not limit ourselves.


Of course, being good at something is important. Except for exceptional circumstances, it is absurd that a programmer who has been writing nodejs for 2 years should switch to java.\
Languages and frameworks are important for the programmer because once they are well learned, the worries about the implementation are reduced.\
Since the programmer knows the features of that language well, he will deal with real problems instead of dealing with small details.


That's been said, they say one language one human. By working on different subjects, we can open our minds and look at things from different angles.
