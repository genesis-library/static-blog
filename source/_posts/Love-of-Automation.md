Sometimes I think errands distract us and slow us down from doing the things we need to do.

Of course, there will always be errands, but if there are any repetitions, we should reduce them as much as possible.

Automation doesn't mean someone is lazy. It shows that he is acting smart.

Why not act smart then?
